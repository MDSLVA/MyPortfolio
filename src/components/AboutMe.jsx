      <p>
        I'm a passionate web developer with a love for creating web applications.
        I have experience in front-end and back-end development and enjoy
        solving complex problems through code. I'm always eager to learn and
        stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy open source contributions, writing technical
        blog posts, and working on personal coding projects. I'm excited to
        share my work and collaborate with other developers to build amazing
        digital experiences.
